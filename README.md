# SassAndCoffee


This library adds simple, drop-in support for Sass/SCSS as well as Coffeescript.

# Thanks to:

Several folks helped me out with some of the integration details of this project - if it weren't for them, I would still be stuck in the mud right now:

* David Padbury for helping me out with the CoffeeScript compiler
* Levi Broderick for giving me a few hints as to how to rig up the HttpModule
* Jimmy Schementi for telling me the proper way to redirect 'requires' to an embedded resource
